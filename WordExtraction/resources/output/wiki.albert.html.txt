was
a
german-born
theoretical
physicist
[5]
who
developed
the
theory
of
relativity
,
one
of
the
two
pillars
of
modern
physics
(alongside
quantum
mechanics
).
[3]

his
work
is
also
known
for
its
influence
on
the
philosophy
of
science.
[7]
[8]
he
is
best
known
to
the
general
public
for
his
mass–energy
equivalence
formula
e
=
mc
2
,
which
has
been
dubbed
"the
world's
most
famous
equation".
[9]
he
received
the
1921
nobel
prize
in
physics
"for
his
services
to
theoretical
physics,
and
especially
for
his
discovery
of
the
law
of
the
photoelectric
effect
",
[10]
a
pivotal
step
in
the
development
of
quantum
theory
.
near
the
beginning
of
his
career,
einstein
thought
that
newtonian
mechanics
was
no
longer
enough
to
reconcile
the
laws
of
classical
mechanics
with
the
laws
of
the
electromagnetic
field
.
this
led
him
to
develop
his
special
theory
of
relativity
during
his
time
at
the
swiss
patent
office
in
bern
(1902–1909),
switzerland.
however,
he
realized
that
the
principle
of
relativity
could
also
be
extended
to
gravitational
fields,
and
he
published
a
paper
on
general
relativity
in
1916
with
his
theory
of
gravitation.
he
continued
to
deal
with
problems
of
statistical
mechanics
and
quantum
theory,
which
led
to
his
explanations
of
particle
theory
and
the
motion
of
molecules
.
he
also
investigated
the
thermal
properties
of
light
which
laid
the
foundation
of
the
photon
theory
of
light.
in
1917,
he
applied
the
general
theory
of
relativity
to
model
the
structure
of
the
universe.
[11]
[12]
einstein
lived
in
switzerland
between
1895
and
1914,
except
for
one
year
in
prague,
and
he
received
his
academic
diploma
from
the
swiss
federal
polytechnic
school
(later
the
eidgenössische
technische
hochschule,
eth)
in
zürich
in
1900.
he
acquired
swiss
citizenship
in
1901,
which
he
kept
for
the
rest
of
his
life
after
being
stateless
for
more
than
five
years.
in
1905,
he
was
awarded
a
phd
by
the
university
of
zurich
.
the
same
year,
he
published
four
groundbreaking
papers
during
his
renowned
annus
mirabilis
(miracle
year)
which
brought
him
to
the
notice
of
the
academic
world
at
the
age
of
26.
einstein
taught
theoretical
physics
at
zurich
between
1912
and
1914
before
he
left
for
berlin,
where
he
was
elected
to
the
prussian
academy
of
sciences
.
in
1933,
while
einstein
was
visiting
the
united
states,
adolf
hitler
came
to
power.
because
of
his
jewish
background,
einstein
did
not
return
to
germany.
[13]
he
settled
in
the
united
states
and
became
an
american
citizen
in
1940.
[14]
on
the
eve
of
world
war
ii
,
he
endorsed
a
letter
to
president
franklin
d.
roosevelt
alerting
him
to
the
potential
development
of
"extremely
powerful
bombs
of
a
new
type"
and
recommending
that
the
us
begin
similar
research.
this
eventually
led
to
the
manhattan
project
.
einstein
supported
the
allied
forces,
but
he
generally
denounced
the
idea
of
using
nuclear
fission
as
a
weapon.
he
signed
the
russell–einstein
manifesto
with
british
philosopher
bertrand
russell
,
which
highlighted
the
danger
of
nuclear
weapons.
he
was
affiliated
with
the
institute
for
advanced
study
in
princeton,
new
jersey,
until
his
death
in
1955.
einstein
published
more
than
300
scientific
papers
and
more
than
150
non-scientific
works.
[11]
[15]
his
intellectual
achievements
and
originality
have
made
the
word
"einstein"
synonymous
with
"genius".
[16]
eugene
wigner
wrote
of
einstein
in
comparison
to
his
contemporaries
that
"einstein's
understanding
was
deeper
even
than
jancsi
von
neumann's
.
his
mind
was
both
more
penetrating
and
more
original
than
von
neumann's.
and
that
is
a
very
remarkable
statement."

albert
einstein
was
born
in
ulm
,
in
the
kingdom
of
württemberg
in
the
german
empire
,
on
14&nbsp;march
1879.
[5]
his
parents
were
hermann
einstein
,
a
salesman
and
engineer,
and
pauline
koch
.
in
1880,
the
family
moved
to
munich
,
where
einstein's
father
and
his
uncle
jakob
founded
elektrotechnische
fabrik
j.
einstein
&amp;
cie
,
a
company
that
manufactured
electrical
equipment
based
on
direct
current
.
[5]
the
einsteins
were
non-observant
ashkenazi
jews
,
and
albert
attended
a
catholic
elementary
school
in
munich,
from
the
age
of
5,
for
three
years.
at
the
age
of
8,
he
was
transferred
to
the
luitpold
gymnasium
(now
known
as
the
albert
einstein
gymnasium),
where
he
received
advanced
primary
and
secondary
school
education
until
he
left
the
german
empire
seven
years
later.
[18]
in
1894,
hermann
and
jakob's
company
lost
a
bid
to
supply
the
city
of
munich
with
electrical
lighting
because
they
lacked
the
capital
to
convert
their
equipment
from
the
direct
current
(dc)
standard
to
the
more
efficient
alternating
current
(ac)
standard.
[19]
the
loss
forced
the
sale
of
the
munich
factory.
in
search
of
business,
the
einstein
family
moved
to
italy,
first
to
milan
and
a
few
months
later
to
pavia
.
when
the
family
moved
to
pavia,
einstein,
then
15,
stayed
in
munich
to
finish
his
studies
at
the
luitpold
gymnasium.
his
father
intended
for
him
to
pursue
electrical
engineering
,
but
einstein
clashed
with
authorities
and
resented
the
school's
regimen
and
teaching
method.
he
later
wrote
that
the
spirit
of
learning
and
creative
thought
was
lost
in
strict
rote
learning
.
at
the
end
of
december
1894,
he
travelled
to
italy
to
join
his
family
in
pavia,
convincing
the
school
to
let
him
go
by
using
a
doctor's
note.
[20]
during
his
time
in
italy
he
wrote
a
short
essay
with
the
title
"on
the
investigation
of
the
state
of
the
ether
in
a
magnetic
field".
[21]
[22]
einstein
always
excelled
at
maths
and
physics
from
a
young
age,
reaching
a
mathematical
level
years
ahead
of
his
peers.
the
twelve
year
old
einstein
taught
himself
algebra
and
euclidean
geometry
over
a
single
summer.
einstein
also
independently
discovered
his
own
original
proof
of
the
pythagorean
theorem
at
age
12.
[23]
a
family
tutor
max
talmud
says
that
after
he
had
given
the
12
year
old
einstein
a
geometry
textbook,
after
a
short
time
"[einstein]
had
worked
through
the
whole
book.
he
thereupon
devoted
himself
to
higher
mathematics...
soon
the
flight
of
his
mathematical
genius
was
so
high
i
could
not
follow."
[24]
his
passion
for
geometry
and
algebra
led
the
twelve
year
old
to
become
convinced
that
nature
could
be
understood
as
a
"mathematical
structure".
[24]
einstein
started
teaching
himself
calculus
at
12,
and
as
a
14
year
old
he
says
he
had
"mastered
integral
and
differential
calculus
".
[25]
at
age
13,
einstein
was
introduced
to
kant
's
critique
of
pure
reason
,
and
kant
became
his
favorite
philosopher,
his
tutor
stating:
"at
the
time
he
was
still
a
child,
only
thirteen
years
old,
yet
kant's
works,
incomprehensible
to
ordinary
mortals,
seemed
to
be
clear
to
him."
[24]
in
1895,
at
the
age
of
16,
einstein
took
the
entrance
examinations
for
the
swiss
federal
polytechnic
in
zürich
(later
the
eidgenössische
technische
hochschule,
eth).
he
failed
to
reach
the
required
standard
in
the
general
part
of
the
examination,
[26]
but
obtained
exceptional
grades
in
physics
and
mathematics.
[27]
on
the
advice
of
the
principal
of
the
polytechnic,
he
attended
the
argovian
cantonal
school
(
gymnasium
)
in
aarau
,
switzerland,
in
1895
and
1896
to
complete
his
secondary
schooling.
while
lodging
with
the
family
of
professor
jost
winteler,
he
fell
in
love
with
winteler's
daughter,
marie.
albert's
sister
maja
later
married
winteler's
son
paul.
[28]
in
january
1896,
with
his
father's
approval,
einstein
renounced
his
citizenship
in
the
german
kingdom
of
württemberg
to
avoid
military
service
.
[29]
in
september
1896,
he
passed
the
swiss
matura
with
mostly
good
grades,
including
a
top
grade
of
6
in
physics
and
mathematical
subjects,
on
a
scale
of
1–6.
[30]
at
17,
he
enrolled
in
the
four-year
mathematics
and
physics
teaching
diploma
program
at
the
zürich
polytechnic.
marie
winteler,
who
was
a
year
older,
moved
to
olsberg
,
switzerland,
for
a
teaching
post.
einstein's
future
wife,
a
20-year
old
serbian
woman
mileva
marić
,
also
enrolled
at
the
polytechnic
that
year.
she
was
the
only
woman
among
the
six
students
in
the
mathematics
and
physics
section
of
the
teaching
diploma
course.
over
the
next
few
years,
einstein
and
marić's
friendship
developed
into
romance,
and
they
read
books
together
on
extra-curricular
physics
in
which
einstein
was
taking
an
increasing
interest.
in
1900,
einstein
passed
the
exams
in
maths
and
physics
and
was
awarded
the
federal
polytechnic
teaching
diploma.
[31]
there
have
been
claims
that
marić
collaborated
with
einstein
on
his
1905
papers,
[32]
[33]
known
as
the
annus
mirabilis
papers
,
but
historians
of
physics
who
have
studied
the
issue
find
no
evidence
that
she
made
any
substantive
contributions.

in
1904
(age
25)
an
early
correspondence
between
einstein
and
marić
was
discovered
and
published
in
1987
which
revealed
that
the
couple
had
a
daughter
named
"lieserl"
,
born
in

1902
in

without
the
child,
whose
real
name
and
fate
are
unknown.
the
contents
of
einstein's
letter
in

1903
suggest
that
the

[40]
they
divorced
on

cared
for
him
and
he
was
also
committed
to

for
several
periods,
finally
being
committed
permanently
after

death.
[43]
in
letters
revealed
in
2015,
einstein
wrote
to
his
early
love
marie
winteler
about
his
marriage
and
his
strong
feelings
for
her.
he
wrote
in
1910,
while
his
wife
was
pregnant
with
their
second
child:
"i
think
of
you
in
heartfelt
love
every
spare
minute
and
am
so
unhappy
as

can
be".
he
spoke
about
a
"misguided
love"
and
a
"missed
life"
regarding
his
love
for
marie.
[44]
einstein
married
elsa

[45]
[46]
after

[54]
in
1903,
his
position
at
the
swiss
patent
office
became
permanent,
although
he
was
passed
over
for
promotion
until
he
"fully
mastered
machine
technology".

much
of
his
work
at
the
patent
office
related
to
questions
about
transmission
of
electric
signals
and
electrical–mechanical
synchronization
of
time,
two
technical
problems
that
show
up
conspicuously
in
the
thought
experiments
that
eventually
led
einstein
to
his
radical
conclusions
about
the
nature
of
light
and
the
fundamental
connection
between
space
and
time.

with
a
few
friends
he
had
met
in
bern,
einstein
started
a
small
discussion
group
in
1902,
self-mockingly
named
"
the
olympia
academy
",
which
met
regularly
to
discuss
science
and
philosophy.
their
readings
included
the
works
of
henri
poincaré
,
ernst
mach
,
and
david
hume
,
which
influenced
his
scientific
and
philosophical
outlook.

was
published
in
the

[57]
[58]
on
30
april
1905,
einstein
completed
his
thesis,
[59]
with
alfred
kleiner
,
professor
of
experimental
physics,
serving
as
pro-forma
advisor.
as
a
result,
einstein
was
awarded
a
phd
by
the
university
of
zürich
,
with
his
dissertation
"
a

".
[59]
[60]
in
that
same
year,
which
has
been
called
einstein's
annus
mirabilis
(miracle
year),
he
published
four
groundbreaking
papers
,
on
the
photoelectric
effect,
brownian
motion
,
special
relativity
,
and
the
equivalence
of
mass
and

which
were
to
bring
him
to
the
notice
of
the
academic
world,
at
the
age
of
26.
academic
career
by
1908,
he
was
recognized
as
a
leading
scientist
and
was
appointed
lecturer
at
the
university
of
bern
.
the
following
year,
after
giving
a
lecture
on
electrodynamics
and
the
relativity
principle
at
the
university
of
zürich,
alfred
kleiner
recommended
him
to
the
faculty
for
a
newly
created
professorship
in
theoretical
physics.
einstein
was
appointed
associate
professor
in
1909.
[61]
einstein
became
a
full
professor
at
the
german
charles-ferdinand
university
in
prague
in
april
1911,
accepting
austrian
citizenship
in
the
austro-hungarian
empire
to
do
so.
[62]
[63]
during
his
prague
stay,
he
wrote
11
scientific
works,
five
of
them
on
radiation
mathematics
and
on
the
quantum
theory
of
solids.
in
july
1912,
he
returned
to
his
alma
mater
in
zürich.
from
1912
until
1914,
he
was
professor
of
theoretical
physics
at
the
eth
zurich
,
where
he
taught
analytical
mechanics
and
thermodynamics
.
he
also
studied
continuum
mechanics
,
the
molecular
theory
of
heat,
and
the
problem
of
gravitation,
on
which
he
worked
with
mathematician
and
friend
marcel
grossmann
.
[64]
on
3
july
1913,
he
was
voted
for
membership
in
the
prussian
academy
of
sciences
in
berlin.
max
planck
and
walther
nernst
visited
him
the
next
week
in
zurich
to
persuade
him
to
join
the
academy,
additionally
offering
him
the
post
of
director
at
the
kaiser
wilhelm
institute
for
physics
,
which
was
soon
to
be
established.
[65]
(membership
in
the
academy
included
paid
salary
and
professorship
without
teaching
duties
at
the
humboldt
university
of
berlin
.)
he
was
officially
elected
to
the
academy
on
24
july,
and
he
accepted
to
move
to
the
german
empire
the
next
year.
his
decision
to
move
to
berlin
was
also
influenced
by
the
prospect
of
living
near
his
cousin
elsa,
with
whom
he
had
developed
a
romantic
affair.
he
joined
the
academy
and
thus
the
berlin
university
on
1
april
1914.
[66]
as
world
war
i
broke
out
that
year,
the
plan
for
kaiser
wilhelm
institute
for
physics
was
aborted.
the
institute
was
established
on
1
october
1917,
with
einstein
as
its
director.
[67]
in
1916,
einstein
was
elected
president
of
the
german
physical
society
(1916–1918).
[68]
based
on
calculations
einstein
made
in
1911,
about
his
new
theory
of
general
relativity,
light
from
another
star
should
be
bent
by
the
sun's
gravity.
in
1919,
that
prediction
was
confirmed
by
sir
arthur
eddington
during
the
solar
eclipse
of
29
may
1919
.
those
observations
were
published
in
the
international
media,
making
einstein
world
famous.
on
7
november
1919,
the
leading
british
newspaper
the
times
printed
a
banner
headline
that
read:
"revolution
in
science&nbsp;–
new
theory
of
the
universe&nbsp;–
newtonian
ideas
overthrown".
[69]
in
1920,
he
became
a
foreign
member
of
the
royal
netherlands
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
.
[70]
in
1922,
he
was
awarded
the
1921
nobel
prize
in
physics
"for
his
services
to
theoretical
physics,
and
especially
for
his
discovery
of
the
law
of
the
photoelectric
effect".
[10]
while
the
general
theory
of
relativity
was
still
considered
somewhat
controversial,
the
citation
also
does
not
treat
the
cited
work
as
an
explanation
but
merely
as
a
discovery
of
the
law
,
as
the
idea
of
photons
was
considered
outlandish
and
did
not
receive
universal
acceptance
until
the
1924

einstein
was
elected
a

member
of
the
royal

(formemrs)
in

.
[3]
he
also
received
the
copley

from
the

albert
einstein
at
a
session
of
the
international
committee
on
intellectual
cooperation
(
league
of
nations
)
of
which
he
was
a
member
from
1922
to
1932.
einstein
visited
new
york
city
for
the
first
time
on
2
april
1921,
where
he
received
an
official
welcome
by
mayor
john
francis
hylan
,
followed
by
three
weeks
of
lectures
and
receptions.
he
went
on
to
deliver
several
lectures
at
columbia
university
and
princeton
university
,
and
in
washington
he
accompanied
representatives
of
the
national
academy
of
science
on
a
visit
to
the
white
house
.
on
his
return
to
europe
he
was
the
guest
of
the
british
statesman
and
philosopher
viscount
haldane
in
london,
where
he
met
several
renowned
scientific,
intellectual
and
political
figures,
and
delivered
a
lecture
at
king's
college
london
.
[71]
[72]
he
also
published
an
essay,
"my
first
impression
of
the
u.s.a.,"
in
july
1921,
in
which
he
tried
briefly
to
describe
some
characteristics
of
americans,
much
as
had
alexis
de
tocqueville
,
who
published
his
own
impressions
in
democracy
in
america
(1835).
[73]
for
some
of
his
observations,
einstein
was
clearly
surprised:
"what
strikes
a
visitor
is
the
joyous,
positive
attitude
to
life
...
the
american
is
friendly,
self-confident,
optimistic,
and
without
envy."
[74]
:
20
in
1922,
his
travels
took
him
to
asia
and
later
to
palestine,
as
part
of
a
six-month
excursion
and
speaking
tour,
as
he
visited
singapore
,
ceylon
and
japan
,
where
he
gave
a
series
of
lectures
to
thousands
of
japanese.
after
his
first
public
lecture,
he
met
the
emperor
and
empress
at
the
imperial
palace
,
where
thousands
came
to
watch.
in
a
letter
to
his
sons,
he
described
his
impression
of
the
japanese
as
being
modest,
intelligent,
considerate,
and
having
a
true
feel
for
art.
[75]
because
of
einstein's
travels
to
the
far
east,
he
was
unable
to
personally
accept
the
nobel
prize
for
physics
at
the
stockholm
award
ceremony
in
december
1922.
in
his
place,
the
banquet
speech
was
held
by
a
german
diplomat,
who
praised
einstein
not
only
as
a
scientist
but
also
as
an
international
peacemaker
and
activist.
[76]
on
his
return
voyage,
he
visited
palestine
for
12
days
in
what
would
become
his
only
visit
to
that
region.
he
was
greeted
as
if
he
were
a
head
of
state,
rather
than
a
physicist,
which
included
a
cannon
salute
upon
arriving
at
the
home
of
the
british
high
commissioner,
sir
herbert
samuel
.
during
one
reception,
the
building
was
stormed
by
people
who
wanted
to
see
and
hear
him.
in
einstein's
talk
to
the
audience,
he
expressed
happiness
that
the
jewish
people
were
beginning
to
be
recognized
as
a
force
in
the
world.
[77]
einstein
visited
spain
for
two
weeks
in
1923,
where
he
briefly
met
santiago
ramón
y
cajal
and
also
received
a
diploma
from
king
alfonso
xiii
naming
him
a
member
of
the
spanish
academy
of
sciences.
[78]
from
1922
to
1932,
einstein
was
a
member
of
the
international
committee
on
intellectual
cooperation
of
the
league
of
nations
in
geneva
(with
a
few
months
of
interruption
in
1923–1924),
[79]
a
body
created
to
promote
international
exchange
between
scientists,
researchers,
teachers,
artists
and
intellectuals.
[80]
originally
slated
to
serve
as
the
swiss
delegate,
secretary-general
eric
drummond
was
persuaded
by
catholic
activists
oskar
halecki
and
giuseppe
motta
to
instead
have
him
become
the
german
delegate,
thus
allowing
gonzague
de
reynold
to
take
the
swiss
spot,
from
which
he
promoted
traditionalist
catholic
values.
[81]
his
former
physics
professor
hendrik
lorentz
and
the
french
chemist
marie
curie
were
also
members
of
the
committee.
1930–1931:
travel
to
the
us
in
december
1930,
einstein
visited
america
for
the
second
time,
originally
intended
as
a
two-month
working
visit
as
a
research
fellow
at
the
california
institute
of
technology
.
after
the
national
attention
he
received
during
his
first
trip
to
the
us,
he
and
his
arrangers
aimed
to
protect
his
privacy.
although
swamped
with
telegrams
and
invitations
to
receive
awards
or
speak
publicly,
he
declined
them
all.
[82]
after
arriving
in
new
york
city,
einstein
was
taken
to
various
places
and
events,
including
chinatown
,
a
lunch
with
the
editors
of
the
new
york
times
,
and
a
performance
of
carmen
at
the
metropolitan
opera
,
where
he
was
cheered
by
the
audience
on
his
arrival.
during
the
days
following,
he
was
given
the
keys
to
the
city
by
mayor
jimmy
walker
and
met
the
president
of
columbia
university,
who
described
einstein
as
"the
ruling
monarch
of
the
mind".
[83]
harry
emerson
fosdick
,
pastor
at
new
york's
riverside
church
,
gave
einstein
a
tour
of
the
church
and
showed
him
a
full-size
statue
that
the
church
made
of
einstein,
standing
at
the
entrance.
[83]
also
during
his
stay
in
new
york,
he
joined
a
crowd
of
15,000
people
at
madison
square
garden
during
a
hanukkah
celebration.

einstein
next
traveled
to
california,
where
he
met
caltech
president
and
nobel
laureate,
robert
a.
millikan
.
his
friendship
with
millikan
was
"awkward",
as
millikan
"had
a
penchant
for
patriotic
militarism,"
where
einstein
was
a
pronounced
pacifist
.
[84]
during
an
address
to
caltech's
students,
einstein
noted
that
science
was
often
inclined
to
do
more
harm
than
good.
[85]
this
aversion
to
war
also
led
einstein
to
befriend
author
upton
sinclair
and
film
star
charlie
chaplin
,
both
noted
for
their
pacifism.
carl
laemmle
,
head
of
universal
studios
,
gave
einstein
a
tour
of
his
studio
and
introduced
him
to
chaplin.
they
had
an
instant
rapport,
with
chaplin
inviting
einstein
and
his
wife,
elsa,
to
his
home
for
dinner.
chaplin
said
einstein's
outward
persona,
calm
and
gentle,
seemed
to
conceal
a
"highly
emotional
temperament,"
from
which
came
his
"extraordinary
intellectual
energy".
[86]
:

chaplin's
film,
city

,
was
to
premiere
a
few
days
later
in
hollywood,
and
chaplin
invited
einstein
and
elsa
to
join
him
as
his
special
guests.
walter
isaacson
,
einstein's
biographer,
described
this
as
"one
of
the
most
memorable
scenes
in
the
new
era
of
celebrity".
[85]
chaplin
visited
einstein
at
his
home
on
a
later
trip
to
berlin,
and
recalled
his
"modest
little
flat"
and
the
piano
at
which
he
had
begun
writing
his
theory.
chaplin
speculated
that
it
was
"possibly
used
as
kindling
wood
by
the
nazis."

in
february
1933
while
on
a
visit
to
the
united
states,
einstein
knew
he
could
not
return
to
germany
with
the
rise
to
power
of
the
nazis
under
germany's
new
chancellor,
adolf
hitler
.
[87]
[88]
while
at
american
universities
in
early
1933,
he
undertook
his
third
two-month
visiting
professorship
at
the
california
institute
of
technology
in
pasadena.
he
and
his
wife
elsa
returned
to
belgium
by
ship
in
march,
and
during
the
trip
they
learned
that
their
cottage
was
raided
by
the
nazis
and
his
personal
sailboat
confiscated.
upon
landing
in
antwerp
on
28
march,
he
immediately
went
to
the
german
consulate
and
surrendered
his
passport,
formally
renouncing
his
german
citizenship.
[89]
the
nazis
later
sold
his
boat
and
converted
his
cottage
into
a
hitler
youth
camp.

when
he
landed
in
dover
(united
kingdom)
from
ostende
(belgium)
to
visit
oxford
.
in
april
1933,
einstein
discovered
that
the
new
german
government
had
passed
laws
barring
jews
from
holding
any
official
positions,
including
teaching
at
universities.
[89]
historian
gerald
holton
describes
how,
with
"virtually
no
audible
protest
being
raised
by
their
colleagues",
thousands
of
jewish
scientists
were
suddenly
forced
to
give
up
their
university
positions
and
their
names
were
removed
from
the
rolls
of
institutions
where
they
were
employed.
[74]
a
month
later,
einstein's
works
were
among
those
targeted
by
the
german
student
union
in
the
nazi
book
burnings
,
with
nazi
propaganda
minister
joseph
goebbels
proclaiming,
"jewish
intellectualism
is
dead."
[89]
one
german
magazine
included
him
in
a
list
of
enemies
of
the
german
regime
with
the
phrase,
"not
yet
hanged",
offering
a
$5,000
bounty
on
his
head.
[89]
[91]
in
a
subsequent
letter
to
physicist
and
friend
max
born
,
who
had
already
emigrated
from
germany
to
england,
einstein
wrote,
"...&nbsp;i
must
confess
that
the
degree
of
their
brutality
and
cowardice
came
as
something
of
a
surprise."
[89]
after
moving
to
the
us,
he
described
the
book
burnings
as
a
"spontaneous
emotional
outburst"
by
those
who
"shun
popular
enlightenment,"
and
"more
than
anything
else
in
the
world,
fear
the
influence
of
men
of
intellectual
independence."
[92]
einstein
was
now
without
a
permanent
home,
unsure
where
he
would
live
and
work,
and
equally
worried
about
the
fate
of
countless
other
scientists
still
in
germany.
he
rented
a
house
in
de
haan,
belgium,
where
he
lived
for
a
few
months.
in
late
july
1933,
he
went
to
england
for
about
six
weeks
at
the
personal
invitation
of
british
naval
officer
commander
oliver
locker-lampson
,
who
had
become
friends
with
einstein
in
the
preceding
years.
to
protect
einstein,
locker-lampson
had
two
assistants
watch
over
him
at
his
secluded

chamberlain
and
former

.
[95]
einstein
asked
them
to
help
bring
jewish
scientists
out
of
germany.
british
historian
martin
gilbert
notes
that
churchill
responded
immediately,
and
sent
his
friend,
physicist
frederick
lindemann
,
to
germany
to
seek
out
jewish
scientists
and
place
them
in
british
universities.
[96]
churchill
later
observed
that
as
a
result
of
germany
having
driven
the
jews
out,
they
had
lowered
their
"technical
standards"
and
put
the
allies'
technology
ahead
of
theirs.
[96]
einstein
later
contacted
leaders
of
other
nations,
including
turkey
's
prime
minister,
i̇smet
i̇nönü
,
to
whom
he
wrote
in
september
1933
requesting
placement
of
unemployed
german-jewish
scientists.
as
a
result
of
einstein's
letter,
jewish
invitees
to
turkey
eventually
totaled
over
"1,000
saved
individuals".
[97]
locker-lampson
also
submitted
a
bill
to
parliament
to
extend
british
citizenship
to
einstein,
during
which
period
einstein
made
a
number
of
public
appearances
describing
the
crisis
brewing
in
europe.
[98]
in
one
of
his
speeches
he
denounced
germany's
treatment
of
jews,
while
at
the
same
time
he
introduced
a
bill
promoting
jewish
citizenship
in
palestine,
as
they
were
being
denied
citizenship
elsewhere.
[99]
in
his
speech
he
described
einstein
as
a
"citizen
of
the
world"
who
should
be
offered
a
temporary
shelter
in
the
uk.
[note

[100]
both
bills
failed,

then
accepted

to
the

and
took
up
a
position
at
the
institute
for
advanced
study,
[98]
[101]
noted
for
having
become
a
refuge
for
scientists
fleeing
nazi
germany.
[102]
at
the
time,
most
american
universities,
including
harvard,
princeton
and
yale,
had
minimal
or
no
jewish
faculty
or
students,
as
a
result
of
their
jewish
quotas
,
which
lasted
until
the
late
1940s.
[102]
einstein
was
still
undecided
on
his
future.
he
had
offers
from
several
european
universities,
including
christ
church,
oxford
where
he
stayed
for
three
short
periods
between
may
1931
and
june
1933
and
was
offered
a
5-year
studentship,
[103]
[104]
but
in
1935
he
arrived
at
the
decision
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states
and
apply
for
citizenship.
[98]
[105]
einstein's
affiliation
with
the
institute
for
advanced
study
would
last
until
his
death
in
1955.
[106]
he
was
one
of
the
four
first
selected
(two
of
the
others
being
john
von
neumann
and
kurt
gödel
)
at
the
new
institute,
where
he
soon
developed
a
close
friendship
with
gödel.
the
two
would
take
long
walks
together
discussing

work.
bruria
kaufman
,
his
assistant,
later
became
a

during
this
period,
einstein
tried
to
develop

and
to
refute
the
accepted
interpretation
of

,

unsuccessfully.

physicist
leó
szilárd
attempted
to
alert
washington
to
ongoing
nazi
atomic

research.
the
group's
warnings
were
discounted.
einstein
and
szilárd,
along
with
other
refugees
such
as
edward
teller
and
eugene
wigner
,
"regarded
it
as
their
responsibility
to
alert
americans
to
the
possibility
that
german
scientists
might
win
the
race
to
build
an
atomic
bomb
,

to
warn
that

would
be

than
willing

resort
to
such
a

[108]
to

aware

in

1939,
a
few
months
before
the
beginning
of
world
war
ii
in
europe,
szilárd
and
wigner
visited
einstein
to
explain
the
possibility
of
atomic
bombs,
which
einstein,
a
pacifist,
said
he
had
never
considered.
[109]
he
was
asked
to
lend
his
support
by
writing
a
letter
,
with
szilárd,
to
president
roosevelt
,
recommending
the
us
pay
attention
and
engage
in
its
own
nuclear
weapons
research.
the
letter
is
believed
to
be
"arguably
the
key
stimulus
for
the
u.s.
adoption
of
serious
investigations
into
nuclear
weapons
on
the
eve
of
the
u.s.
entry
into
world
war
ii".
[110]
in
addition
to
the
letter,
einstein
used
his
connections
with
the
belgian
royal
family
[111]
and
the
belgian
queen
mother
to
get
access
with
a
personal
envoy
to
the
white
house's
oval
office.
some
say
that
as
a
result
of
einstein's
letter
and
his
meetings
with
roosevelt,
the
us
entered
the
"race"
to
develop
the
bomb,
drawing
on
its
"immense
material,
financial,
and
scientific
resources"
to
initiate
the
manhattan
project
.
for
einstein,
"war
was
a
disease&nbsp;...
[and]
he
called
for
resistance
to
war."
by
signing
the
letter
to
roosevelt,
some
argue
he
went
against
his
pacifist
principles.
[112]
in
1954,
a
year
before
his
death,
einstein
said
to
his
old
friend,
linus
pauling
,
"i
made
one
great
mistake
in
my
life—when
i
signed
the
letter
to
president
roosevelt
recommending
that
atom
bombs
be
made;
but
there
was
some
justification—the
danger
that
the

would

long
after

(in

he
expressed
his
appreciation
of
the

when
compared
to
europe.
he
recognized
the
"right
of
individuals
to
say

think
what
they
pleased",
without
social
barriers,
and
as
a
result,
individuals
were

(naacp)
in

where
he
campaigned
for
the
civil

he
considered

america's
"worst

[91]
seeing
it
as
"handed
down

[116]
as

einstein
visited

in

a
historically
black
college
,
where
he
was
awarded
an
honorary
degree.
(lincoln

grant
college
degrees
to

einstein
gave
a
speech
about
racism
in
america,
adding,
"i
do
not

about
it."
[119]
a

once
paid
the
college

for
a
black
student.
[118]
assisting

causes
einstein
was
a
figurehead
leader
in
helping
establish
the
hebrew
university
of
jerusalem
,
which
opened
in
1925,
and
was
among
its
first
board
of
governors.
earlier,
in
1921,
he
was
asked
by
the
biochemist
and
president
of
the
world
zionist
organization
,
chaim
weizmann
,
to
help
raise
funds
for
the
planned
university.
[120]
he
also
submitted
various
suggestions
as
to
its
initial
programs.
among
those,
he
advised
first
creating
an
institute
of
agriculture
in
order
to
settle
the
undeveloped
land.
that
should
be
followed,
he
suggested,
by
a
chemical
institute
and
an
institute
of
microbiology,
to
fight
the
various
ongoing
epidemics
such
as
malaria
,
which
he
called
an
"evil"
that
was
undermining
a
third
of
the
country's
development.

and
at
the
urging
of
ezriel

,
prime
minister
david
ben-gurion
offered
einstein
the
position
of
president
of
israel
,
a
mostly
ceremonial
post.
[122]
[123]
the
offer
was
presented
by
israel's
ambassador
in

abba
eban
,
who
explained
that
the
offer
"embodies
the
deepest
respect
which
the
jewish
people
can
repose
in
any
of
its
sons".
[124]
einstein
declined,
and
wrote
in
his
response
that
he
was
"deeply
moved",
and
"at
once
saddened
and
ashamed"
that
he
could
not
accept
it.

einstein
(right)
with

and
nobel
laureate
rabindranath
tagore
,
1930
einstein
developed
an
appreciation
for
music
at
an
early
age,
and
later
wrote:
"if
i
were
not
a
physicist,
i
would
probably
be
a
musician.
i
often
think
in
music.
i
live
my
daydreams
in
music.
i
see
my
life
in
terms
of
music...
i
get
most
joy
in
life
out
of
music."
[125]
[126]
his
mother
played
the
piano
reasonably
well
and
wanted
her
son
to
learn
the
violin
,
not
only
to
instill
in
him
a
love
of
music
but
also
to
help
him
assimilate
into
german
culture
.
according
to
conductor
leon
botstein
,
einstein
began
playing
when
he
was
5,
although
he
did
not
enjoy
it
at
that
age.
[127]
when
he
turned
13,
he
discovered
the
violin
sonatas
of
mozart
,
whereupon
"einstein
fell
in
love"
with
mozart's
music
and
studied
music
more
willingly.
he
taught
himself
to
play
without
"ever
practicing
systematically",
he
said,
deciding
that
"love
is
a
better
teacher
than
a
sense
of
duty."
[127]
at
age
17,
he
was
heard
by
a
school
examiner
in
aarau
as
he
played
beethoven
's
violin
sonatas
,
the
examiner
stating
afterward
that
his
playing
was
"remarkable
and
revealing
of
'great
insight'."
what
struck
the
examiner,
writes
botstein,
was
that
einstein
"displayed
a
deep
love
of
the
music,
a
quality
that
was
and
remains
in
short
supply.
music
possessed
an
unusual
meaning
for
this
student."
[127]
music
took
on
a
pivotal
and
permanent
role
in
einstein's
life
from
that
period
on.
although
the
idea
of
becoming
a
professional
musician
himself
was
not
on
his
mind
at
any
time,
among
those
with
whom
einstein
played
chamber
music
were
a
few
professionals,
and
he
performed
for
private
audiences
and
friends.
chamber
music
had
also
become
a
regular
part
of
his
social
life
while
living
in
bern,
zürich,
and
berlin,
where
he
played
with
max
planck
and
his
son,
among
others.
he
is
sometimes
erroneously
credited
as
the
editor
of
the
1937
edition
of
the
köchel
catalogue
of
mozart's
work;
that
edition
was
prepared
by
alfred
einstein
,
who
may
have
been
a
distant
relation.
[128]
[129]
in
1931,
while
engaged
in
research
at
the
california
institute
of
technology,
he
visited
the
zoellner
family
conservatory
in
los
angeles,
where
he
played
some
of
beethoven
and
mozart's
works
with
members
of
the
zoellner
quartet
.
[130]
[131]
near
the
end
of
his
life,
when
the
young
juilliard
quartet
visited
him
in
princeton,
he
played
his
violin
with
them,
and
the
quartet
was
"impressed
by
einstein's
level
of
coordination
and
intonation".

was
in
favor

critical
of
capitalism,
which
he
detailed
in
his
essays
such
as
"

[132]
[133]
einstein
offered
and
was
called
on
to
give
judgments
and
opinions
on
matters
often
unrelated
to
theoretical
physics
or
mathematics.
[98]
he
strongly
advocated
the
idea
of
a
democratic
global
government
that
would
check
the
power
of
nation-states
in
the
framework
of
a
world
federation.
[134]
the

on
einstein
in

and
by
the
time
of
his
death
his
fbi
file
was
1,427
pages
long.
[135]
einstein
was
deeply
impressed
by
mahatma
gandhi
.
he
exchanged
written
letters
with
gandhi,
and
called
him
"a
role
model
for
the
generations
to
come"
in
a
letter
writing
about
him.
[136]
einstein
spoke
of
his
spiritual
outlook
in
a
wide
array
of
original
writings
and
interviews.
[137]
einstein
stated
that
he
had
sympathy
for
the
impersonal
pantheistic
god
of
baruch
spinoza's
philosophy
.
[138]
he
did
not
believe
in
a
personal
god
who
concerns
himself
with
fates
and
actions
of
human
beings,
a
view
which
he
described
as
naïve.
[139]
he
clarified,
however,
that
"i
am
not
an
atheist",
[140]
preferring
to
call
himself
an
agnostic
,
[141]
or
a
"deeply
religious
nonbeliever."
[139]
when
asked
if
he
believed
in
an
afterlife
,
einstein
replied,
"no.
and
one
life
is
enough
for
me."
[142]
einstein
was
primarily
affiliated
with
non-religious
humanist
and
ethical
culture
groups
in
both
the
uk
and
us.
he
served
on
the
advisory
board
of
the
first
humanist
society
of
new
york
,
[143]
and
was
an
honorary
associate
of
the
rationalist
association
,
which
publishes
new
humanist
in
britain.
for
the
seventy-fifth
anniversary
of
the
new
york
society
for
ethical
culture
,
he
stated
that
the
idea
of
ethical
culture
embodied
his
personal
conception
of
what
is
most
valuable
and
enduring
in
religious
idealism.
he
observed,
"without
'ethical
culture'
there
is
no
salvation
for
humanity."
[144]
death
on
17
april
1955,
einstein
experienced
internal
bleeding
caused
by
the
rupture
of
an
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
,
which
had
previously
been
reinforced
surgically
by
rudolph
nissen
in
1948.
[145]
he
took
the
draft
of
a
speech
he
was
preparing
for
a
television
appearance
commemorating
the
state
of
israel's
seventh
anniversary
with
him
to
the
hospital,
but
he
did
not
live
long
enough
to
complete
it.
[146]
einstein
refused
surgery,
saying,
"i
want
to
go
when
i
want.
it
is
tasteless
to
prolong
life
artificially.
i
have
done
my
share;
it
is
time
to
go.
i
will
do
it
elegantly."
[147]
he
died
in
princeton
hospital
early
the
next
morning
at
the
age
of
76,
having
continued
to
work
until
near
the
end.
[148]
during
the
autopsy,
the
pathologist
of
princeton
hospital,
thomas
stoltz
harvey
,
removed
einstein's
brain
for
preservation
without
the
permission
of
his
family,
in
the
hope
that
the
neuroscience
of
the

it

with

which
translates
as
"conclusions

two
papers
he
published
in
1902–1903
(thermodynamics)
attempted
to
interpret
atomic

from
a
statistical

of
view.
these
papers
were
the
foundation
for
the
1905
paper
on

which
showed
that

can
be

einstein
returned
to
the
problem
of
thermodynamic
fluctuations,
giving
a
treatment
of
the
density
variations
in
a
fluid
at
its
critical
point.
ordinarily
the
density
fluctuations
are
controlled
by
the
second
derivative
of
the
free
energy
with
respect
to
the
density.
at
the
critical
point,
this
derivative
is
zero,
leading
to
large
fluctuations.
the
effect
of
density
fluctuations
is
that
light
of
all
wavelengths
is
scattered,
making
the
fluid
look
milky
white.
einstein
relates
this
to
rayleigh
scattering
,
which
is
what
happens
when
the
fluctuation
size
is
much
smaller
than
the
wavelength,
and
which
explains
why
the
sky
is
blue.
[161]
einstein
quantitatively
derived
critical
opalescence
from
a
treatment
of
density
fluctuations,
and
demonstrated
how
both
the
effect
and
rayleigh
scattering
originate
from
the
atomistic
constitution
of
matter.

[163]
observationally,

these
changes
are
most
apparent
at
high
speeds
(where

are

close

the
theory
developed
in
this
paper
later
became
known
as
einstein's
special

of

this
paper
predicted
that,
when
measured
in
the
frame
of
a
relatively
moving
observer,
a
clock
carried
by
a

would
appear
to

also
argued
that
the
idea
of
a

—one
of
the
leading
theoretical
entities
in

at
the
time—was
superfluous.

einstein's
1905
work
on
relativity
remained
controversial
for
many
years,
but
was
accepted
by
leading
physicists,
starting
with
max
planck
.
[165]
[166]
einstein
originally
framed
special
relativity
in
terms
of
kinematics
(the
study
of
moving
bodies).
in
1908,
hermann
minkowski
reinterpreted
special
relativity
in
geometric
terms
as
a
theory
of
spacetime
.

adopted

in

1915
general

general
relativity
(gr)
is
a
theory
of
gravitation
that
was
developed
by
einstein
between
1907
and
1915.
according
to
general
relativity
,
the
observed
gravitational
attraction
between
masses
results
from
the
warping
of
space
and
time
by
those
masses.
general
relativity
has
developed
into
an
essential
tool
in
modern
astrophysics
.
it
provides
the
foundation
for
the
current
understanding
of
black
holes
,
regions
of
space
where
gravitational
attraction
is
so
strong
that
not
even
light
can
escape.
as
einstein
later
said,
the
reason
for
the
development
of
general
relativity
was
that
the
preference
of
inertial
motions
within
special
relativity
was
unsatisfactory,
while
a
theory
which
from
the
outset
prefers
no
state
of
motion
(even
accelerated
ones)
should
appear
more
satisfactory.
[168]
consequently,
in
1907
he
published
an
article
on
acceleration
under
special
relativity.
in
that
article
titled
"on
the
relativity
principle
and
the
conclusions
drawn
from
it",
he
argued
that
free
fall
is
really
inertial
motion,
and
that
for
a
free-falling
observer
the
rules
of
special
relativity
must
apply.
this
argument
is
called
the
equivalence
principle
.
in
the
same
article,
einstein
also
predicted
the
phenomena
of
gravitational
time
dilation
,
gravitational
red
shift
and
deflection
of
light
.
[169]
[170]
in
1911,
einstein
published
another
article
"on
the
influence
of
gravitation
on
the
propagation
of
light"
expanding
on
the
1907
article,
in
which
he
estimated
the
amount
of
deflection
of
light
by
massive
bodies.
thus,
the
theoretical
prediction
of
general
relativity
could
for
the
first
time
be
tested
experimentally.
[171]
gravitational
waves
in
1916,
einstein
predicted
gravitational
waves
,
[172]
[173]
ripples
in
the
curvature
of
spacetime
which
propagate
as
waves
,
traveling
outward
from
the
source,
transporting
energy
as
gravitational
radiation.
the
existence
of
gravitational
waves
is
possible
under
general
relativity
due
to
its
lorentz
invariance
which
brings
the
concept
of
a
finite
speed
of
propagation
of
the
physical
interactions
of
gravity
with
it.
by
contrast,
gravitational
waves
cannot
exist
in
the
newtonian
theory
of
gravitation
,
which
postulates
that
the
physical
interactions
of
gravity
propagate
at
infinite
speed.
the
first,
indirect,
detection
of
gravitational
waves
came
in
the
1970s
through
observation
of
a
pair
of
closely
orbiting
neutron
stars
,
psr
b1913+16
.
[174]
the
explanation
of
the
decay
in
their
orbital
period
was
that
they
were
emitting
gravitational
waves.
[174]
[175]
einstein's
prediction
was
confirmed
on
11
february
2016,
when
researchers
at
ligo
published
the
first
observation
of
gravitational
waves
,
[176]
detected
on
earth
on
14
september
2015,
exactly
one
hundred
years
after
the
prediction.

hole

theory
main
article:
hole
argument
while
developing
general
relativity,
einstein
became
confused
about
the
gauge
invariance
in
the
theory.
he
formulated
an
argument
that
led
him
to
conclude
that
a
general
relativistic
field
theory
is
impossible.
he
gave
up
looking
for
fully
generally
covariant
tensor
equations,
and
searched
for
equations
that
would
be
invariant
under
general
linear
transformations
only.
in
june
1913,
the
entwurf
("draft")
theory
was
the
result
of
these
investigations.
as
its
name
suggests,
it
was
a
sketch
of
a
theory,
less
elegant
and
more
difficult
than
general
relativity,
with
the
equations
of
motion
supplemented
by
additional
gauge
fixing
conditions.
after
more
than
two
years
of
intensive
work,
einstein
realized
that
the
hole
argument
was
mistaken
[181]
and
abandoned
the
theory
in
november
1915.

v
t
e
in
1917,
einstein
applied
the
general
theory
of
relativity
to
the
structure
of
the
universe
as
a
whole.
[182]
he
discovered
that
the
general
field
equations
predicted
a
universe
that
was
dynamic,
either
contracting
or
expanding.
as
observational
evidence
for
a
dynamic
universe
was
not
known
at
the
time,
einstein
introduced
a
new
term,
the
cosmological
constant
,
to
the
field
equations,
in
order
to
allow
the
theory
to
predict
a
static
universe.
the
modified
field
equations
predicted
a
static
universe
of
closed
curvature,
in
accordance
with
einstein's
understanding
of
mach's
principle
in
these
years.
this
model
became
known
as
the
einstein
world
or
einstein's
static
universe
.
[183]
[184]
following
the
discovery
of
the
recession
of
the
nebulae
by
edwin
hubble
in
1929,
einstein
abandoned
his
static
model
of
the
universe,
and
proposed
two
dynamic
models
of
the
cosmos,
the
friedmann-einstein
universe
of
1931
[185]
[186]
and
the
einstein–de
sitter
universe
of
1932.
[187]
[188]
in
each
of
these
models,
einstein
discarded
the
cosmological
constant,
claiming
that
it
was
"in
any
case
theoretically
unsatisfactory".
[185]
[186]
[189]
in
many
einstein
biographies,
it
is
claimed
that
einstein
referred
to
the
cosmological
constant
in
later
years
as
his
"biggest
blunder".
the
astrophysicist
mario
livio
has
recently
cast
doubt
on
this
claim,
suggesting
that
it
may
be
exaggerated.
[190]
in
late
2013,
a
team
led
by
the
irish
physicist
cormac
o'raifeartaigh
discovered
evidence
that,
shortly
after
learning
of
hubble's
observations
of
the
recession
of
the
nebulae,
einstein
considered
a
steady-state
model
of
the
universe.
[191]
[192]
in
a
hitherto
overlooked
manuscript,
apparently
written
in
early
1931,
einstein
explored
a
model
of
the
expanding
universe
in
which
the
density
of
matter
remains
constant
due
to
a
continuous
creation
of
matter,
a
process
he
associated
with
the
cosmological
constant.
[193]
[194]
as
he
stated
in
the
paper,
"in
what
follows,
i
would
like
to
draw
attention
to
a
solution
to
equation
(1)
that
can
account
for
hubbel's
[
sic
]
facts,
and
in
which
the
density
is
constant
over
time"
...
"if
one
considers
a
physically
bounded
volume,
particles
of
matter
will
be
continually
leaving
it.
for
the
density
to
remain
constant,
new
particles
of
matter
must
be
continually
formed
in
the
volume
from
space."
it
thus
appears
that
einstein
considered
a
steady-state
model
of
the
expanding
universe
many
years
before
hoyle,
bondi
and
gold.
[195]
[196]
however,
einstein's
steady-state
model
contained
a
fundamental
flaw
and
he
quickly
abandoned
the
idea.

stress–energy–momentum
pseudotensor
general
relativity
includes
a
dynamical
spacetime,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
to
identify
the
conserved
energy
and
momentum.
noether's
theorem
allows
these
quantities
to
be
determined
from
a
lagrangian
with
translation
invariance
,
but
general
covariance
makes
translation
invariance
into
something
of
a
gauge
symmetry
.
the
energy
and
momentum
derived
within
general
relativity
by
noether's
presecriptions
do
not
make
a
real
tensor
for
this
reason.
einstein
argued
that
this
is
true
for
fundamental
reasons,
because
the
gravitational
field
could
be
made
to
vanish
by
a
choice
of
coordinates.
he
maintained
that
the
non-covariant
energy
momentum
pseudotensor
was
in
fact
the
best
description
of
the
energy
momentum
distribution
in
a
gravitational
field.
this
approach
has
been
echoed
by
lev
landau
and
evgeny
lifshitz
,
and
others,
and
has
become
standard.
the
use
of
non-covariant

pseudotensors
was
heavily
criticized
in
1917
by

in

einstein
collaborated
with

rosen
to
produce
a
model
of
a
wormhole
,
often
called
einstein–rosen
bridges
.
[198]
[199]
his
motivation
was
to
model
elementary
particles
with
charge
as
a
solution
of
gravitational
field
equations,
in
line
with
the
program
outlined
in
the
paper
"do
gravitational
fields
play
an
important
role
in
the
constitution
of
the
elementary

these
solutions
cut
and
pasted
schwarzschild
black
holes
to
make
a
bridge
between
two
patches.
[200]
if
one
end
of
a
wormhole
was
positively
charged,
the
other
end
would
be
negatively
charged.
these
properties
led
einstein
to
believe
that
pairs
of
particles
and
antiparticles
could
be
described
in
this
way.

the

needed
to
be
generalized
to
include

was
made
by

equations

main

einstein–infeld–hoffmann
equations
the
theory
of

has
a
fundamental
law—the
einstein
equations
which
describe
how
space
curves,
the
geodesic
equation
which
describes
how
particles
move
may
be
derived
from
the
einstein
equations.
since
the
equations
of
general
relativity
are
non-linear,
a
lump
of
energy
made
out
of
pure
gravitational
fields,
like
a
black
hole,
would
move
on
a
trajectory
which
is
determined
by
the
einstein
equations
themselves,
not
by
a
new
law.
so
einstein
proposed
that
the
path
of
a
singular
solution,
like
a
black
hole,
would
be
determined
to
be
a
geodesic
from
general
relativity
itself.
this
was
established
by
einstein,
infeld,
and
hoffmann
for
pointlike
objects
without
angular
momentum,
and
by

for

in
a
1905
paper,
[201]
einstein
postulated
that

itself
consists
of

(
quanta
).
einstein's
light
quanta
were
nearly
universally
rejected
by
all
physicists,
including
max
planck
and
niels
bohr.
this
idea
only
became
universally
accepted
in
1919,
with
robert
millikan
's
detailed
experiments
on
the
photoelectric
effect,
and
with
the
measurement
of
compton

.
einstein
concluded
that
each
wave
of
frequency
f
is
associated
with
a
collection
of
photons
with
energy
hf
each,
where
h
is
planck's

.
he
does
not
say
much
more,
because
he
is
not
sure
how
the
particles
are
related
to
the

but
he
does
suggest
that
this

would
explain

quantized

main

solid
in
1907,
einstein
proposed
a
model
of
matter
where
each
atom
in
a
lattice
structure
is
an
independent
harmonic
oscillator.
in
the
einstein
model,
each
atom
oscillates
independently—a
series
of
equally
spaced
quantized
states
for
each
oscillator.
einstein
was
aware
that
getting
the
frequency
of
the
actual
oscillations
would
be
difficult,
but
he
nevertheless
proposed
this
theory
because
it
was
a
particularly
clear
demonstration
that
quantum

could
solve
the
specific

adiabatic

main
article:
adiabatic

throughout
the
1910s,
quantum
mechanics
expanded
in
scope
to
cover
many
different
systems.
after
ernest
rutherford
discovered
the
nucleus
and
proposed
that
electrons
orbit
like
planets,
niels
bohr
was
able
to
show
that
the
same
quantum
mechanical
postulates
introduced
by
planck
and
developed
by
einstein
would
explain
the
discrete
motion
of
electrons
in
atoms,
and
the
periodic
table
of
the
elements
.
einstein
contributed
to
these
developments
by
linking
them
with
the
1898
arguments
wilhelm
wien
had
made.
wien
had
shown
that
the
hypothesis
of
adiabatic
invariance
of
a
thermal
equilibrium
state
allows
all
the
blackbody
curves
at
different
temperature
to
be
derived
from
one
another
by
a
simple
shifting
process
.
einstein
noted
in
1911
that
the
same
adiabatic
principle
shows
that
the
quantity
which
is
quantized
in
any
mechanical
motion
must
be
an
adiabatic
invariant.
arnold
sommerfeld
identified
this
adiabatic
invariant
as
the
action

of

submitted
his

them
the

that
some

[203]
it
was

with
modern
quantum
mechanics
as
it
had
evolved
after

contrary
to
popular
belief,
his
doubts
were
not
due
to
a
conviction
that
god
"is
not
playing
at

[208]
indeed,
it
was
einstein
himself,
in
his
1917
paper
that
proposed
the
possibility
of
stimulated
emission
,
[207]
who
first
proposed
the
fundamental
role
of
chance
in
explaining
quantum
processes.
[209]
rather,
he
objected
to
what
quantum
mechanics
implies
about
the
nature
of
reality.
einstein
believed
that
a
physical
reality
exists
independent
of
our
ability
to
observe
it.
in
contrast,
bohr
and
his
followers
maintained
that
all
we
can
know
are
the
results

that
it
makes

speculate
about

returned
to
the
question
of
quantum
mechanics
in
the
"epr
paper"

[213]
in

,
he
considered
two
particles
which
had
interacted
such
that
their
properties
were
strongly
correlated.
no
matter
how
far
the
two
particles
were
separated,
a
precise
position
measurement
on
one
particle
would
result
in
equally
precise
knowledge
of
the
position
of
the
other
particle;
likewise
a
precise
momentum
measurement
of
one
particle
would
result
in
equally
precise
knowledge
of
the
momentum
of
the
other
particle,
without
needing
to
disturb
the
other
particle
in
any
way.
[214]
given
einstein's
concept
of
local
realism
,
there
were
two
possibilities:
(1)
either
the
other
particle
had
these
properties
already
determined,
or
(2)
the
process
of
measuring
the
first
particle
instantaneously
affected
the
reality
of
the
position
and
momentum
of
the
second
particle.
einstein
rejected
this
second
possibility
(popularly
called
"spooky
action
at
a
distance").
[214]
this
principle
distilled
the
essence
of
einstein's
objection
to
quantum
mechanics.
as
a
physical
principle,
it
was
shown
to
be
incorrect

,
which
j.

bell

of
these
and
subsequent
experiments
demonstrate
that
quantum
physics
cannot
be
represented
by
any
version
of
the
classical
picture
of

[215]
although
einstein
was
wrong,
his

the
new
yorker
published
a
vignette
in
their
"the
talk
of
the
town"
feature
saying
that
einstein
was
so
well
known
in
america
that
he
would
be
stopped
on
the
street
by
people
wanting
him
to
explain
"that
theory".
he
finally
figured
out
a
way
to
handle
the
incessant
inquiries.
he
told
his
inquirers
"pardon
me,
sorry!
always
i
am
mistaken
for
professor
einstein."
[226]
einstein
has
been
the
subject
of
or
inspiration
for
many
novels,
films,
plays,
and
works
of
music.
[227]
he
is
a
favorite
model
for
depictions
of
mad
scientists
and
absent-minded
professors
;
his
expressive
face
and
distinctive
hairstyle
have
been
widely
copied
and
exaggerated.
time
magazine's
frederic
golden
wrote
that
einstein
was
"a
cartoonist's
dream
come
true".
[228]
many
popular
quotations
are
often
misattributed
to
him.

einstein's
awards
and
honors
einstein
received
numerous
awards
and
honors
and
in
1922
he
was
awarded
the
1921
nobel
prize
in
physics
"for
his
services
to
theoretical
physics,
and
especially
for
his
discovery
of
the
law
of
the
photoelectric
effect".
none
of
the
nominations
in
1921
met
the
criteria
set
by
alfred
nobel
,
so
the
1921
prize
was
carried
forward
and
awarded
to
einstein
in
1922.
